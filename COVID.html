<h2><i><u>Covid Protocoal</u></i></h2>
<p>The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kerala (which was also the first confirmed case in all of India) was confirmed in Thrissur on 30 January 2020.[2][3] On 12 May 2021 Kerala reported the largest single day spike with 43,529 new cases. As of 30 July 2021, there have been 33,70,137 confirmed cases, test positivity rate is at 13.61% (12.46% cumulative), with 31,92,104 (94.72%) recoveries and 16,701 deaths in the state.Initially, Kerala's success in containing COVID-19 was widely praised both nationally and internationally,Following high number of cases being reported in March, Kerala had, by April 30, reduced the rate of increase of new cases to less than 0.25% per day. However, in mid-May, there was an increase or "second wave" of new cases, following the return of Keralites from other countries and other Indian states. </p></div>
<h4><u>Lockdown Phase 1</u></h4>
<p>Following the detection of positive cases, the government of Kerala declared a 'state calamity warning' on 4 February. Over 3000 contacts of the affected individuals were placed under quarantine, out of which 45 were placed in hospital quarantine. The three positive individuals later recovered from the infection following hospital care. The 'state calamity' warning was withdrawn after 4 days, when no further cases were reported. As China was a popular country for students from Kerala to pursue medical studies, several medical students got stranded in China when the lock-down due to coronavirus was put into effect. Some of them, who were stranded in airports in China were evacuated and flown into Cochin International Airport and quarantined at isolation wards in Kochi Medical College. However, none of them later tested positive for the disease.</p>
